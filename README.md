This repository includes the implementation code for the paper *Amplified Early Stopping Bias: Overestimated Performance with Deep Learning*. 

The three experiments mentioned in the paper can be run using files `train_real.py`, `train_synth.py`, and `train_random.py`. The visualization code is in `data_analysis/visualize_results`. An example of how to run the experiments is presented in `example.ipynb`.
